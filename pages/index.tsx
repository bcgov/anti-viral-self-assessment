            COVID-19 treatments are currently available in B.C. and may benefit some people who have
            recently tested positive for COVID-19.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have been shown to prevent COVID-19 from getting worse in high-risk patients with
            mild to moderate symptoms, if taken within 5 to 7 days of symptoms starting.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            These treatments do not prevent COVID-19, before or after an exposure. Important safety
            considerations, like how they interact with other medications, may limit their use for
            some people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, these treatments are recommended for people who are identified as having an
            increased risk for needing to go to the hospital for COVID-19.

          Find out if you might benefit from treatment
        </p>

        <p>
          Answer each question carefully. Your responses will help to determine if it would be safe
          for you to receive treatment for COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it looks like you might benefit from the treatment, you will be directed to call
          Service BC for further assessment. They will review these questions in more detail with
          you, and may connect you to a healthcare team who can access your medication and health
          information. The healthcare team will seek more information and make decisions based on
          their clinical assessment.

          If you are unable to fill out the questionnaire online and need help to complete it over
          the phone, please call Service BC at <ServiceBCLink />.
